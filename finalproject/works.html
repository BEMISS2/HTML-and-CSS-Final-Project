                        <p>Benzie Area Historical Museum had a main exhibit called "Summer Fun in the Benzie Sun" in Summer 2018, and it 
                            consisted of a recreational summer sports exhibit, a W.H. Sharp photography exhibit, and a vintage array of Benzie County 
                            area school photos. These design pieces were used to promote this "Summer Fun in the Benzie Sun" event. 
                            Their main goal with this event was to attract both locals that have enjoyed the Museum for many years, and tourist with 
                            their families visiting the area over the summer. Simple wave lines and graphics allow the piece to breath, but still 
                            add a fun flare. The final piece is graphic, as it uses single color icons to illustrate the events, and fun colorized 
                            vintage images from the Benzie Area Historical Museum archives. The colors chosen were a process CMYK Blue, Red, and 
                            Yellow, all middle tone based, these colors embody the fun and summer excitement.</p>

                        <p>This packaging design serves the purpose of selling the product in store displays. It also holds other jewelry pieces 
                            in an envelope style packaging. This dual purpose design (with locking tabs and an earring holding insert) allows the 
                            consumer to transport additional jewelry for changing looks on a night out, or a vacation. The “Que Sera” brand name comes 
                            from a saying that means “whatever will be”, because with the dual purpose of carrying extra jewelry, the consumer will 
                            be ready for everything and anything. The barcode is a women’s side profile (showing the earring) to create a fun element 
                            for the consumer. The design was created by hand painting abstract flower made of lines to create the fun flirtatious pattern.</p>

                        <p>The goal with this project was to create an identity system and a promotional mailer for the Tea clothing 
                            company. This design includes references to Tea's global acquaintances and clothing materials. The yarn ball 
                            and leaves, apparent in the logo, represent many of Tea's company values. The yarn sphere, symbolizes Tea’s 
                            desire for unity and relationships with nations across the world. The arched lines, symbolize not only a ball 
                            of yarn, but materials and textiles, which relate back to the product of clothing. The leaf symbols are a 
                            representation of not only the growth of children, but also the unending inspiration for their clothing line 
                            from the natural world. The earthy toned colors used in this identity system embody the natural elements like 
                            sky and earth, which influence the Tea clothing line. The logos typeface is called Menjelajah Halmahera. 
                            It is India inspired to reflect the cultural influence on the company. The use of the yarn ball relates to 
                            materials, the sphere shape relates to international affairs, and the leaves show the natural influence Tea utilizes.</p>

                        <p>For this NMC Student Art Show poster design, the idea was to create a new and innovative poster campaigning 
                            for student submissions. The NMC art show is an opportunity for student to submit works of art. Students works 
                            are showcased and awarded cash prizes, if applicable. This poster includes a heavy use of rectangles, 
                            both vertical and horizontal, to create an overall shape, flow, and eye catching aesthetic. The font choices 
                            used in this poster were a Berlin Email and a Mixolydian Titling. This poster was the contest winner and was 
                            displayed all over campus to inform students that submissions were needed.</p>

                        <p>This piece was the annual poster for the Fountain Point Music Festival for the Summer of 2018. Fountain 
                            Point Music holds a summer concert series every summer for soulful, folk, and Indy music enthusiast. 
                            The posters goal is to share the summer concerts line up and where individuals can get tickets. 
                            My inspiration for this poster was the splashes from water fountains. Instruments and music notes were 
                            hand painted to create fun shapes amongst the splash brush strokes. The colors chosen are a cream and 
                            vibrant shades of orange and red as they embody Folk and Indy tones. The fonts used are a Raskey and Selima</p>

                        <p>Rosie’s Country Cafe is a small country establishment that specializes in delicious homemade foods and offers a 
                            welcoming, rustic environment for its visitors. The goal of this menu is to show the aesthetic of the restaurant 
                            and really give off a homemade food vibe. The menu accomplishes this by using earthy tones, worn textures, lightly 
                            texture Jute Vellum Paper and fonts that fit the rustic charm and ambiance of Rosie’s. A new identity was created for 
                            Rosie’s. A logo featuring a rooster emerging from the steam of a coffee cup was the main symbolism. The worn texture 
                            invites the viewer into the menu and conveys the restaurants overall feel.</p>

                        <p>These two photos are two of my favorites taken in my photography class. The top photo 
                            is of the Manistee Ghost Ship. This is one of my favorite photos because of its exploration 
                            of tiny details within the massive ship. The bottom photo is of a generic neon business sign 
                            taken at dusk. This is one of my favorites because of its color play, and its ability to draw 
                            the viewer into its lit path in an abstract way.</p>

                            simple san-serif typeface creates balance. The concept includes eyes and communication bubbles to represent our 
                            degree’s name "Visual Communications". This design was chosen as the winner. It was sent out to design 
                            professionals in the area inviting them to join us for the portfolio review of my graduating class.</p>

                        <p>This is my personal identity system. It embodies myself in many ways. The recurring stripe pattern and 
                            hexagonal shape references a bee. Their perseverance and actions to always make the world more beautiful, 
                            inspires me. The bee also references my last name "be"miss. The flourishes in my logo represent my personality. 
                            I am an individual who values going the extra mile and finessing things in order for a piece to be pleasing 
                            to the eye. The layering of the K and B represent the layers of myself. As I grow as an artist’s, I find 
                            myself peeling off layer after layer of self-doubt and becoming more confident in my abilities. 
                            The typeface chosen is called Poppins, which is a nod to my love of poppy flowers and san-serif typeface.</p>

                            looking to extend their education to gain career and life skills. Students with cognitive disabilities 
                            have limited experience in their education which stem from “formalized structured” programs offered in 
                            K-12 plus programs around the region. Our final piece is highly graphic, it uses simple, single color 
                            icons to illustrate some of the course offerings, in a less wordy way. This accordion brochure is 
                            intended to act as an evergreen that informs individuals of where to access the NMC S.O.A.R application 
                            and general course information. The format is laid out in a way that allows the reader to assess each 
                            page left to right, easily. The colors chosen were a PMS 341C, which is the NMC Green, and PMS 108 C 
                            Yellow with tints of each. The typefaces used are Verdana and Century Gothic, for easy readability.</p>

                        <p>This type book design was created to show consistency and type organization. The idea behind this 
                            piece was to use a provided short story, “A Type House Divided” by Jason Fagone, about the type 
                            foundry feud of Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones. Photos and pull quotes from the text were 
                            used to create visual interest. The colors used were black and orange, because they embody caution 
                            and creativity which illustrates Hoefler and Frere-Jones relationship. The typefaces used were 
                            Roboto and Gill Sans. The overall goal was to illustrate and tell the relationship of Hoefler 
                            and Frere-Jones in a graphic and compelling way to maintain a reader's attention.</p>

                        <summary>CALLING CARDS</summary>
                        <p>These calling cards were designed for famous book characters and AIGA medalist. The idea 
                            behind each card was be influenced by their characteristics and careers. Alice’s card 
                            embodies her innocent and sophisticated personality, it uses script and whimsical serif 
                            typefaces. Katniss Everdeen's, from The Hunger Games, card plays with her archery skills 
                            and “girl on fire” title. Katniss is an empowering woman. These organic and structured 
                            fonts both show her strength and femininity. Gere Kavanagh is an AIGA medalist who designs 
                            primarily in 60’s style. Her card incorporates her 60’s influence, and the freely feminine 
                            feel that Gere encompasses. Mark Randall is also a AIGA medalist. He primarily designs for social 
                            and environmental causes. He acknowledges that designers should be like bees, and work for the 
                            collective good. His card is intended to show this concept and include strong san-serif typefaces.</p>

                        <summary>THE BOOK OF OPPOSITES</summary>
                        <p>The concept behind this piece was to create a book displaying the opposites of typography such, 
                            as masculine and feminine, or tall and short. This book uses popular novels and examples of 
                            opposite fonts to show how a font can affect the overall appearance of a novels design. Ultimately, 
                            the goal of this design is to influence its audience to understand that type choice matters, and to 
                            show the opposite pairs of type in the universe. The overall book design was also influenced by an old, 
                            vintage novel jacket with the use of classical scroll, and red and gold gradients. </p>
